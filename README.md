Implementation of some simple Quantum systems in Julia

## FDschemes.jl
Calculates the eigenstates and energys of some simple Quantum Mechnical systems using finite difference schemes. Then the probablility densities are plotted with respect to their energies. It is obvious, that the high energy state in the Harmonic Oscillator are not correct.
